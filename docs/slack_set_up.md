# Slack Set Up

## Team Settings and Permissions

### Settings

Enable "Require @ for mentions" so that people aren't notified every time their name is mentioned in passing. An individual member can still set up highlight words to get notifications, but don't force them to get those notifications.

### Permissions

Consider using the following Messaging permissions (screenshot below).

- I prefer not to completely shut down @channel and @here mentions as sometimes they are useful for members.
- However, always give a warning to remind members to use it sparingly, and only when needed.
- Since the #general (renamed to #announcements in the screenshot) channel is the one channel that all members must stay in, limit posts only to owners and admins.
- Similarly, shut down @everyone mentions to only team members and admins.

## Channel Options

Rename #general to #announcements or something similar to emphasize it is not for general chatter. This is the one channel that all members must be a member of. They cannot leave this channel so minimize chatter.

Rename #random to #watercooler or something similar to emphasize this is the space that members are welcome to use for any chatter. This helps redirect potentially distracting conversations out of business channels and into the "fun zone".
