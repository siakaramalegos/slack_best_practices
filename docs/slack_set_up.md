### Permissions

**Messaging**
Set this to "Always":
"By default, team members are shown a warning before sending a message containing @channel. You can choose to disable this warning or show it less often."

## Channel Options

Rename #general to #announcements or something similar to emphasize it is not for general chatter. This is the one channel that all members must be a member of. They cannot leave this channel so minimize chatter.

Rename #random to #watercooler or something similar to emphasize this is the space that members are welcome to use for any chatter. This helps redirect potentially distracting conversations out of business channels and into the "fun zone".
