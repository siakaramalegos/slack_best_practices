# Managing Information Overload

## Tools for Managing Tabs and Articles to Read

Are you a tab-hoarding monster? I am. 

I use [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com/) and [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/) to help Konmari my browser and minimize process usage. 

The [Pocket app](https://getpocket.com/) is also a great way to "save" stuff for future reading.
